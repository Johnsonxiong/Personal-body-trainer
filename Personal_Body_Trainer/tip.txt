Dear CIS705 students (CIS505 students: please ignore this message!)

As part of your course requirements, you should read and present a research paper.

You should select a paper that has at some time been published in either of the yearly conferences
* POPL (Principles of Programming Languages), or
* PLDI (Programming Language Design and Implementation).
(If you log in from a CS machine, it should be easy to download papers from these conferences.)

You should aim at a 15 minutes presentation, with 5 minutes for questions. We aim to select among the following time slots:
Fri Dec 1: 11:30am-12:30pm, 1:30-4:30pm
Tue Dec 5: 1-5pm
Thu Dec 7: 10am-1pm
With 3 presentations per hour, this should be more than enough to accommodate everyone. Please go to https://doodle.com/poll/zzbd4czb8m98988h  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.and select the slots you will be available.

When you have decided which paper to present, please let me know (I will encourage you not to wait too long as no paper can be presented by two students), and email me a pdf version.

If you present using powerpoint slides, they must be based on the template found at
https://www.k-state.edu/vpcm/resources/powerpoint/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
Let me know if you plan to use some other tool for producing slides, like the beamer class in LaTeX.

In your presentation, make sure to explain in some detail (among other things):
* the motivation for the work --- which problem does it address?
* example(s) that illustrate the approach

best regards, Torben Amtoft

union function            5
intersect function        5
difference function       5
Input and output (correct format), main.cpp   4
Create Set objects (pointer), deallocate at end of function   5
Documentation 2

after input the first vector, it corrupts.   -20

Miss quit option.  -3

Difference function is just A / B.    -3

Insert function.   -3

Okay, if so , you should notice that in your output, But you did not, So you output format is not friendly enough, I will regrade it again. But take 2 points out of the output format.
